## 🏥 Problem Statement

Clinics struggle with managing high volumes of appointment requests and patient queries. Manual handling leads to missed slots, delays, and poor communication. Most platforms do not support regional languages, leaving patients underserved. Clinics also lack intelligent agents to handle queries without human intervention.

- Patients experience delays and poor communication while booking.
- Manual scheduling leads to errors, inefficiencies, and missed slots.
- Limited support for regional languages excludes many rural patients.
- Clinics lack 24x7 intelligent systems for appointment and query handling.

---

## 🏥 Proposed Solution

Our platform solves this with two advanced AI voice agents — one for handling appointments and the other for patient queries. Once the user fills a form on the website, they instantly receive a call from the AI agent to confirm the booking and collect more details. Simultaneously, confirmation emails are sent. Another agent calls users who submit contact forms, answering FAQs in their preferred language.

- AI-powered agents handle appointment bookings and patient queries via voice calls.
- Real-time confirmation via email and phone after form submission.
- Fully automated appointment scheduling integrated with Google Calendar.
- All data stored in Google Sheets and displayed on a secure doctor admin panel.
